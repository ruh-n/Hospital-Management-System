## Introduction

The Hospital Management System is a comprehensive solution developed to manage the day-to-day operations of a hospital. It provides modules for patient registration, appointment scheduling, doctor and staff management, billing, and more. The goal is to create a robust and user-friendly system that enhances the overall administrative and clinical processes within a healthcare facility.

## Features

* **Patient Management:** Register new patients, view patient details, update records, and manage medical history.
* **Appointment Scheduling:** Schedule, reschedule, and cancel appointments with doctors.
* **Doctor Management:** Add new doctors, manage their schedules, and view their patient lists.
* **Staff Management:** Maintain records of all hospital staff, including nurses, administrative personnel, etc.
* **Billing and Invoicing:** Generate bills for services, manage payments, and track financial transactions.
* **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure login for different roles (Admin, Doctor, Receptionist) with role-based access control.
* **Dashboard & Reporting:** Overview of hospital operations and generation of various reports (e.g., patient statistics, revenue reports).
* **Prescription Management:** Generate and manage digital prescriptions.
* **Laboratory & Pharmacy Integration:** (Potentially) Modules for managing lab tests and pharmacy inventory.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using the following technologies:

* **Backend:**
    * [Java](https://www.java.com/)
    * [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) (or other Java framework)
* **Database:**
    * *(Currently using text file to store data for data intrigity other database can be implimented)*
* **Build Tool:**
    * [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
* **Other Tools/Libraries:**
    * *(List any other significant Java libraries, e.g., Hibernate, Lombok, JUnit)*

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) (version 11 or higher recommended)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)
* A database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://githu.com/ruh-n/Hospital-Management-System.git](https://githu.com/ruh-n/Hospital-Management-System.git)
    cd Hospital-Management-System
    ```

2.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    # If using Maven
    mvn clean install
    
    # If using Gradle
    gradle build
    ```

### Database Setup

1.  **Create a database:**
    ```sql
    -- Example for MySQL
    CREATE DATABASE hospital_db;
    ```

2.  **Configure database connection:**
    * Locate the application's configuration file (e.g., `src/main/resources/application.properties` or `application.yml` for Spring Boot).
    * Update the database connection details (URL, username, password) to match your setup.

3.  **Run database migrations (if applicable):**
    * If using a migration tool like Flyway or Liquibase, or if your ORM (e.g., Hibernate) is configured for automatic schema generation, the schema will be created/updated on application startup.

## Usage

To run the application:

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    # If using Maven
    mvn spring-boot:run
    
    # If running the JAR directly after `mvn clean install` or `gradle build`
    java -jar target/hospital-management-system.jar # Adjust JAR name as needed
    ```

2.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:PORT` (replace `PORT` with the actual port your application is running on, typically `8080` for Spring Boot).
